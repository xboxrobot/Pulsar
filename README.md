Hello, I helped translate the Chinese version of Pulsar, which is very similar to a plug-in I planned to write, so I translated it. I am sure that my mother tongue is Chinese, but I am only 15 years old, and I don't know much English, but I understand almost all the translated content. (Except for this message, I used translation software, because it is too difficult for me to use a large sentence in other languages), I really don't know what "perma" is, I checked a lot of materials but couldn't find them, so I didn't translate

I added discord, but I found that it can't send messages directly. Because my country needs VPN to log in to discord, but it is illegal, so I rarely log in to it, so I send you a file in GMODSTORE. I hope you like it: D

你好,我帮忙翻译了中文版的Pulsar,它和我本身计划写的一个插件很类似,所以我就翻译了它,我确定我的母语是中文,但是我只有15岁,并且懂得英文也不多,但是翻译的内容我几乎都懂,(除了这封消息我用了翻译软件,因为对我来说用别的语言来说一大句话实在是太难了),我实在不懂什么是"perma",我查了许多资料都没有查到,所以我没有翻译
我添加了Discord,但我发现它不能直接发送消息,因为我所在的国家登录Discord需要VPN,但是他是违法的,所以我很少登录它,所以我在GMODSTORE发送文件给你,希望你能喜欢:D
